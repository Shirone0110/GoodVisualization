        <h1>What is a good Visualization?</h1>
        <section id = "intro">
            <p>
                Based on Alberto Cairo's <i>The Truthful Art</i>, there are 5 qualities that make up a good visualization:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is truthful</li>
                <li>It is functional</li>
                <li>It is beautiful</li>
                <li>It is insightful</li>
                <li>It is enlightening</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In these following examples, we will discuss more about each of the quality.

                Take a look at this global warming data visualization at Bloomberg Businessweek: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/">What's warming the world?</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Cool, isn't it? Now let's see why it's ...
            </p>
            <ol class = "qualities">
                <li class = "one">
                    <h3>Truthful</h3>
                    At the end of the website, there is a part <b>What the Lines Show</b> stated that data was taken from GISS's <a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/mi08910y.html">article</a>. So we can tell that this information is official and trustworthy.
                </li>
                <li class = "two">
                    <h3>Functional</h3>
                    The data was presented by 2 lines at a time, comparing the change of one element or a group of element with the base change. The lines are place at the same position so that people can compare them easily.
                </li>
                <li class = "three">
                    <h3>Beautiful</h3>
                    The lines have different color for easy distinguish, with proper scale so that the line fluctuation is big and clear. The plot area is empty and white, the dot area near the line has a light color makes it more pleasing to look at.
                </li>
                <li class = "four">
                    <h3>Insightful</h3>
                    Have you ever think of other reasons for global warming rather than carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect? Well i haven't. These graphs show that there are also natural factors, and there is even factor that decrease the average temperature. And when we put all of them together, they match the observed temperature. This has also emphasize that the most important factor is still greenhouse gases.
                </li>
                <li class = "five">
                    <h3>Enlightening</h3>
                    Global warming has been one of the principal topic that humankind have to face, but many people still hasn't realize how much their actions are impacting on global warming. This visualization is also a warning towards everyone.

            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id = "bad">
            <p>Now let's see this graph here, also about global warming:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "BadExample.jpg" alt = "Bad Example" height = "551" width = "770" />
                <figcaption>
                    Global warming caused by lack of pirates <br />
                    <i>Source: <a href="https://www.sisense.com/blog/global-warming-caused-lack-pirates-bad-graph-lessons/">Global Warming Caused by Lack of Pirates</a></i>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Now let's see why it's NOT ...
            </p>
            <ol class = "qualities">
                <li class = "one">
                    <h3>Truthful</h3>
                    Just because it's correlated doesn't mean it's causality. A graph like this can be misleading and create wrong beliefs. So this graph isn't truthful. 
                </li>
                <li class = "two">
                    <h3>Functional</h3>
                    Therefore, it's not functional neither. There's no information that can be used from this data. 
                </li>
                <li class = "three">
                    <h3>Beautiful</h3>
                    From the artistic aspect, the graph is big and clear, but the value in the x-axis is decreasing instead of increasing like in normal graph, it can be confusing if people just glance at it. And the position of the skullcaps doesn't relate to the number of pirates. From 1820 t0 1860, the number of pirates increase and the skullcaps still go up.
                </li>
                <li class = "four">
                    <h3>Insighting or Enlightening</h3>
                    Although this graph is also about global warming, but it doesn't give any actual meaning.
